Great question ðŸš€ â€” this is **one of the most asked interview questions** too! Letâ€™s break it down with a clear explanation.

# ðŸ“¦ `package.json` vs `package-lock.json`

---

## 1. **`package.json`**

* Itâ€™s your projectâ€™s **manifest file** (like a recipe).
* Lists:

  * Project name, version, author, scripts.
  * Dependencies (`dependencies` and `devDependencies`).
* Defines **what you want**, not the exact details of how itâ€™s installed.

### Example:

```json
{
  "name": "ts-todo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ Here:

* `express` has version `^4.18.0` â†’ means *any minor/patch update* is acceptable (`4.18.x`, `4.19.x`).
* `typescript` has `^5.0.0` â†’ means `5.0.x`, `5.1.x` etc. are allowed.

---

## 2. **`package-lock.json`**

* Itâ€™s the **exact installation record** (like a receipt).
* Locks the **exact versions** of every dependency **and their sub-dependencies**.
* Ensures that if you install the project later (or on another machine), you get the **exact same dependency tree**.

### Example (snippet):

```json
{
  "name": "ts-todo",
  "lockfileVersion": 3,
  "dependencies": {
    "express": {
      "version": "4.18.2",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.18.2.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-xyz...",
      "requires": {
        "body-parser": "^1.20.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ Here:

* Even though `package.json` said `^4.18.0`, the lock file says **exactly `4.18.2`**.
* It also records **sub-dependencies** like `body-parser`.

# ðŸ”‘ Key Differences

| Feature               | `package.json`                        | `package-lock.json`                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Purpose               | Project manifest (what you want)      | Exact dependency tree (what you got)  |
| Versions              | Allows version ranges (`^`, `~`, `*`) | Stores exact versions (`4.18.2`)      |
| Sub-dependencies      | Not listed                            | Fully listed                          |
| Required for running  | Yes                                   | Not strictly (but highly recommended) |
| Version control (git) | Always commit                         | Always commit (ensures same builds)   |

# âœ… Summary

* **`package.json`** â†’ blueprint ("I want express \~4.18").
* **`package-lock.json`** â†’ lock-in ("I got express 4.18.2 and these exact sub-deps").

Without `package-lock.json`, two developers might install **different versions** of the same library and run into bugs.
