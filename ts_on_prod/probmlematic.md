Ah! This is a very important question — why your `"prod"` script is using **`ts-node`** instead of compiled JavaScript. Let me explain carefully.

---

### 1️⃣ What your current prod script does

```json
"prod": "ts-node src/index.ts"
```

* `ts-node` **compiles TypeScript on the fly** and runs it directly.
* It means in production your server is running TypeScript **without pre-compiling**.

### 2️⃣ Why this is **not ideal for production**

| Issue                  | Explanation                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**        | `ts-node` compiles TS to JS on the fly → slower startup and runtime.                                             |
| **Stability**          | Compilation happens at runtime → errors might occur only when server starts.                                     |
| **Extra dependencies** | `ts-node` and `typescript` must be installed in production (`devDependencies` normally) → increases bundle size. |
| **Debugging**          | Stack traces may be harder to interpret compared to compiled JS.                                                 |

### 3️⃣ Recommended production setup

**Step 1: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript**

```bash
tsc
```

* This creates a `dist/` folder with all `.js` files.

**Step 2: Run the compiled JS**

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

* This is much faster and more stable.
* No need for `ts-node` or `typescript` in production.

**Updated `package.json` scripts:**

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon src/index.ts",
  "build": "tsc",
  "prod": "node dist/index.js"
}
```

---

### 4️⃣ Example workflow

```bash
# Development
npm run dev   # ts-node with auto-reload

# Build for production
npm run build # compile TS -> JS

# Run production server
npm run prod  # run compiled JS
```

---

✅ **Key takeaway**

* `ts-node` is **great for development** (fast iteration, live reload).
* In **production**, always run compiled JavaScript (`node dist/index.js`) for **performance and stability**.
