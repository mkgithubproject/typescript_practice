Ah! This is a very important question — why your `"prod"` script is using **`ts-node`** instead of compiled JavaScript. Let me explain carefully.

---

### 1️⃣ What your current prod script does

```json
"prod": "ts-node src/index.ts"
```

* `ts-node` **compiles TypeScript on the fly** and runs it directly.
* It means in production your server is running TypeScript **without pre-compiling**.

### 2️⃣ Why this is **not ideal for production**

| Issue                  | Explanation                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**        | `ts-node` compiles TS to JS on the fly → slower startup and runtime.                                             |
| **Stability**          | Compilation happens at runtime → errors might occur only when server starts.                                     |
| **Extra dependencies** | `ts-node` and `typescript` must be installed in production (`devDependencies` normally) → increases bundle size. |
| **Debugging**          | Stack traces may be harder to interpret compared to compiled JS.                                                 |

---

### 3️⃣ Recommended production setup

**Step 1: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript**

```bash
tsc
```

* This creates a `dist/` folder with all `.js` files.

**Step 2: Run the compiled JS**

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

* This is much faster and more stable.
* No need for `ts-node` or `typescript` in production.

**Updated `package.json` scripts:**

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon src/index.ts",
  "build": "tsc",
  "prod": "node dist/index.js"
}
```

---

### 4️⃣ Example workflow

```bash
# Development
npm run dev   # ts-node with auto-reload

# Build for production
npm run build # compile TS -> JS

# Run production server
npm run prod  # run compiled JS
```

---

✅ **Key takeaway**

* `ts-node` is **great for development** (fast iteration, live reload).
* In **production**, always run compiled JavaScript (`node dist/index.js`) for **performance and stability**.

Not really — deploying raw TypeScript (`.ts`) files on a production server is **not considered best practice**. Here’s why and what’s recommended:

### 1️⃣ Why it’s **not ideal**

| Reason                   | Explanation                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**          | TypeScript must be compiled on the fly (`ts-node`) → slower startup and slightly slower runtime.  |
| **Stability**            | Compilation happens at runtime → compilation errors could crash the server if not caught in dev.  |
| **Dependencies**         | You must install `ts-node` and `typescript` on the server → extra packages you don’t really need. |
| **Debugging**            | Stack traces may be harder to read; source maps help but add complexity.                          |
| **Security / File Size** | `.ts` files + dev dependencies increase deployment bundle size unnecessarily.                     |

---

### 2️⃣ Recommended practice

1. **Compile TypeScript locally (or in CI/CD pipeline)**

```bash
tsc
```

* This outputs plain JavaScript files in a `dist/` folder.

2. **Deploy compiled JavaScript to the server**

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

* Only the **compiled JS**, your **runtime dependencies**, and necessary **assets/config** go to production.

3. **Optional:** Use a build tool or Docker to bundle everything neatly.

---

### 3️⃣ Benefits of deploying compiled JS

| Benefit                      | Explanation                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Faster startup**           | No on-the-fly compilation.                                   |
| **Smaller production image** | Only runtime dependencies needed.                            |
| **More reliable**            | Compilation errors are caught before deployment.             |
| **Cleaner deployment**       | No devDependencies like `typescript` or `ts-node` on server. |

---

### 4️⃣ Typical workflow

```bash
# Development
npm run dev   # ts-node with live reload

# Build
npm run build # compile TS -> JS (dist/ folder)

# Production
npm run prod  # node dist/index.js
```

---

✅ **Key takeaway:**

* **Never deploy raw TypeScript** in production.
* Always compile to JavaScript and deploy the compiled output.
* `ts-node` is **dev-only**.

If you want, I can rewrite your **package.json scripts and project setup** in a way that is fully production-ready for TypeScript Node.js. It will separate dev, build, and prod perfectly.

Do you want me to do that?
