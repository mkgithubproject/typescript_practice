Ah! Now I get exactly why you’re confused. Let me clarify carefully — this is a subtle but super important point in **TypeScript + Node.js**.

---

### 1️⃣ Key idea , if i installed both package `@types/bcrypt and bcrypt, then at complie time type script will use for type checking `@types/bcrypt and at run time bcrypt will be used

Even though you have **two separate packages installed**:

1. `bcrypt` → actual library with code
2. `@types/bcrypt` → TypeScript type definitions

**TypeScript doesn’t “run” anything**. It only **checks types** and gives IntelliSense.

**Node.js** runs the actual code.

Think of it like this:

| Role                         | Package used    | When?                          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Type checking & autocomplete | `@types/bcrypt` | Development / compilation only |
| Running code                 | `bcrypt`        | Runtime (dev or production)    |

---

### 2️⃣ How TypeScript “knows” which library

When you write:

```ts
import bcrypt from "bcrypt";
```

TypeScript does this:

1. It looks for **the actual module `bcrypt`** in `node_modules/bcrypt` → this is what will be executed.
2. It looks for **type definitions**:

   * First, it checks if the module has built-in types (`bcrypt` doesn’t).
   * Then, it looks for a matching `@types/bcrypt` in `node_modules/@types/bcrypt`.
   * It combines these definitions with the code so you get full type safety and autocomplete.

**Important:** You **never import `@types/bcrypt`** directly. It just tells TypeScript: “Hey, these are the types for `bcrypt`.”

---

### 3️⃣ Analogy

* `bcrypt` = the **car** (does the work)
* `@types/bcrypt` = the **manual** (tells you how to drive it safely)
* You **drive the car** using `bcrypt` — the manual never goes into the engine.

---

### 4️⃣ Visual idea

```
Code:          import bcrypt from "bcrypt";
TypeScript:    reads @types/bcrypt for type info
Node.js:       executes bcrypt at runtime
```

---

✅ **Takeaway**

* You **write code using `bcrypt`**.
* TypeScript **automatically uses `@types/bcrypt`** behind the scenes.
* You **never have to worry** about which package “runs” during development — TypeScript just uses the types, Node uses the code.

---

If you want, I can draw a **small diagram showing exactly how TypeScript and Node pick `bcrypt` vs `@types/bcrypt`** — it’s very easy to remember visually.

Do you want me to draw that?
