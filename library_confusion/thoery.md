Ah! Now I get exactly why you’re confused. Let me clarify carefully — this is a subtle but super important point in **TypeScript + Node.js**.

---

### 1️⃣ Key idea , if i installed both package `@types/bcrypt and bcrypt, then at complie time type script will use for type checking `@types/bcrypt and at run time bcrypt will be used

Even though you have **two separate packages installed**:

1. `bcrypt` → actual library with code
2. `@types/bcrypt` → TypeScript type definitions

**TypeScript doesn’t “run” anything**. It only **checks types** and gives IntelliSense.

**Node.js** runs the actual code.

Think of it like this:

| Role                         | Package used    | When?                          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Type checking & autocomplete | `@types/bcrypt` | Development / compilation only |
| Running code                 | `bcrypt`        | Runtime (dev or production)    |

---

### 2️⃣ How TypeScript “knows” which library

When you write:

```ts
import bcrypt from "bcrypt";
```

TypeScript does this:

1. It looks for **the actual module `bcrypt`** in `node_modules/bcrypt` → this is what will be executed.
2. It looks for **type definitions**:

   * First, it checks if the module has built-in types (`bcrypt` doesn’t).
   * Then, it looks for a matching `@types/bcrypt` in `node_modules/@types/bcrypt`.
   * It combines these definitions with the code so you get full type safety and autocomplete.

**Important:** You **never import `@types/bcrypt`** directly. It just tells TypeScript: “Hey, these are the types for `bcrypt`.”

---

### 3️⃣ Analogy

* `bcrypt` = the **car** (does the work)
* `@types/bcrypt` = the **manual** (tells you how to drive it safely)
* You **drive the car** using `bcrypt` — the manual never goes into the engine.

---

### 4️⃣ Visual idea

```
Code:          import bcrypt from "bcrypt";
TypeScript:    reads @types/bcrypt for type info
Node.js:       executes bcrypt at runtime
```

---

✅ **Takeaway**

* You **write code using `bcrypt`**.
* TypeScript **automatically uses `@types/bcrypt`** behind the scenes.
* You **never have to worry** about which package “runs” during development — TypeScript just uses the types, Node uses the code.

---

Exactly — here’s the precise distinction:

---

### `@types/bcrypt`

* **Does NOT have the actual bcrypt code**.
* **Only contains type definitions** (`.d.ts` files).
* Example of what it contains:

```ts
declare module "bcrypt" {
  export function genSalt(rounds?: number): Promise<string>;
  export function hash(data: string, salt: string): Promise<string>;
  export function compare(data: string, encrypted: string): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

* It **cannot hash passwords or do anything at runtime**.
* Its sole purpose is **TypeScript type checking and editor autocomplete**.

---

### `bcrypt`

* **Contains the real, executable library code**.
* This is what actually performs hashing and comparison.
* This is the library Node.js will execute when you call:

```ts
const hash = await bcrypt.hash("password123", 10);
```

---

✅ **Key point:**

* `bcrypt` = full working library → **runtime + development**
* `@types/bcrypt` = type info only → **development only**, no runtime code

---

Ah! This is a critical scenario — let’s break it down carefully.

---

### 1️⃣ What happens if you **only install `@types/bcrypt`**

* TypeScript will **think `bcrypt` exists** because it reads the type definitions from `@types/bcrypt`.
* Your editor will show **no type errors** when you write code like:

```ts
import bcrypt from "bcrypt";

const hash = await bcrypt.hash("password123", 10);
```

* **BUT at runtime**, Node.js will try to load `bcrypt` **and fail**, because there is **no actual code**.

You’ll get an error like:

```
Error: Cannot find module 'bcrypt'
```

---

### 2️⃣ Why this happens

* `@types/bcrypt` only provides `.d.ts` files — **no executable code**.
* TypeScript uses them for **type checking only**, it does not create or include the real library in the compiled JS.
* Node.js runs the JS code; if the actual library (`bcrypt`) is missing, it **cannot execute anything**.

---

### ✅ Summary

| Scenario                       | TypeScript                                       | Runtime                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Only `@types/bcrypt` installed | ✅ Code compiles (type checking works)            | ❌ Fails at runtime (module not found) |
| Only `bcrypt` installed        | ❌ TypeScript shows type errors / no autocomplete | ✅ Works at runtime                    |
| Both installed                 | ✅ TypeScript + ✅ Runtime                         | ✅ Works perfectly                     |

---

So, **you must install `bcrypt`** if you want your code to actually run.
`@types/bcrypt` is just optional, for TypeScript type safety.

If you want, I can make a **tiny diagram showing exactly what happens when you install only one of them vs both** — it clears this up instantly.

Do you want me to do that?
