Perfect 👏 — this is a **very common confusion** and a **crucial concept** to understand deeply.

Let’s clarify exactly what **cascade: true** means in TypeORM (and in relational databases in general), and how it behaves for **insert**, **update**, and **delete** operations.

---

# 🧩 1️⃣ First — What “Cascade” Means Conceptually

> **Cascade** means that when you perform an operation on a **parent entity**,
> that operation **automatically propagates** to its **related child entities**.

In simple terms:

> “Whatever happens to the parent — should also happen to its children.”

---

# 🧱 2️⃣ Example Schema

Let’s say you have two entities:

```ts
// User.ts
@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  name: string;

  @OneToMany(() => Post, (post) => post.user, { cascade: true })
  posts: Post[];
}
```

```ts
// Post.ts
@Entity()
export class Post {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  title: string;

  @ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.posts)
  user: User;
}
```

---

# 🧠 3️⃣ The Meaning of `cascade: true`

When you write:

```ts
@OneToMany(() => Post, (post) => post.user, { cascade: true })
```

It means **insert and update cascades** will occur automatically for that relation.

✅ So, if you do this:

```ts
const user = new User();
user.name = 'Alice';
user.posts = [
  { title: 'Post 1' },
  { title: 'Post 2' }
];

await dataSource.manager.save(user);
```

👉 TypeORM will **automatically insert** both the `User` and its `Post` records,
even though you didn’t call `save()` on `Post`.

---

# ⚙️ 4️⃣ Important: Cascade types

You can control **which operations** cascade.

```ts
@OneToMany(() => Post, (post) => post.user, {
  cascade: ['insert', 'update', 'remove'],
})
```

| Cascade Option  | What it Does                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `'insert'`      | Saves child entities automatically when parent is saved |
| `'update'`      | Updates child entities automatically                    |
| `'remove'`      | Removes child entities when parent is removed           |
| `'soft-remove'` | Soft deletes child entities when parent is soft-deleted |
| `'recover'`     | Recovers child entities automatically                   |
| `true`          | Shortcut for `['insert', 'update', 'remove']`           |

---

# 🚫 5️⃣ Cascade does **NOT** block delete!

Here’s the **key misunderstanding** you mentioned 👇

> “Cascade true means I cannot delete parent until I delete child?”

❌ **No! Cascade doesn’t block deletes.**

Cascade is about **propagation**, not **restriction**.

If you delete the parent:

* With `cascade: ['remove']` → the child rows are also deleted automatically.
* Without cascade remove → you’ll get a **foreign key constraint error** (if your DB enforces referential integrity).

---

# 🧩 6️⃣ Example — Delete with cascade

```ts
@OneToMany(() => Post, (post) => post.user, { cascade: ['remove'] })
```

Then:

```ts
const user = await dataSource.getRepository(User).findOne({
  where: { id: 1 },
  relations: ['posts'],
});

await dataSource.getRepository(User).remove(user);
```

✅ This will **automatically delete**:

* The `User` record
* All related `Post` records

---

# 🧩 7️⃣ Without cascade remove

If you remove without cascade:

```ts
@OneToMany(() => Post, (post) => post.user)
```

Then:

```ts
await userRepository.remove(user);
```

❌ You’ll likely get:

```
QueryFailedError: Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails
```

Because the database still has posts referencing this user.

---

# 🧠 8️⃣ Cascade vs. onDelete

There’s another related option called `onDelete` (database-level).

```ts
@ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.posts, { onDelete: 'CASCADE' })
```

| Option                | Layer     | Description                                                |
| --------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cascade`             | ORM-level | TypeORM automatically performs the operation in code       |
| `onDelete: 'CASCADE'` | DB-level  | Database automatically deletes rows when parent is deleted |

✅ Usually, you use **both**:

```ts
@ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.posts, {
  onDelete: 'CASCADE',
})
```

So deletion cascades happen even if the database is accessed outside TypeORM.

# 🧩 10️⃣ TL;DR (Short answer to your question)

> ❓ “Does `cascade: true` mean I can’t delete parent until I delete child?”

**No.**

* `cascade: true` means **operations on parent automatically apply to child**.
* If you delete the parent:

  * With `cascade: ['remove']` or `onDelete: 'CASCADE'` → children get deleted too ✅
  * Without it → deletion fails (foreign key constraint) ❌

---

Excellent — you’ve hit one of the **most common real-world errors** in TypeORM and SQL:

> 🧨 **`QueryFailedError: Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails`**

Let’s go deep and solve this **step-by-step**, so you fully understand **why** it happens and **all possible ways** to handle it safely — *with or without cascade* 👇

---

## 🧩 1️⃣ Why the Error Happens

Suppose you have these tables:

```ts
User (parent)
Post (child)
```

and in your `Post` entity:

```ts
@ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.posts)
user: User;
```

This creates a foreign key constraint in SQL like:

```sql
FOREIGN KEY (userId) REFERENCES user(id)
```

Meaning:

> Each `post.userId` must match a valid `user.id`.

---

Now if you try to delete the user:

```ts
await userRepository.delete(1);
```

but there are still `Post` rows referencing that user,
the **database stops you** because deleting the user would leave orphaned `Post` rows with invalid `userId`.

Hence the error:

```
QueryFailedError: Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails
```

---

## 🧩 2️⃣  Ways to Delete Without Cascade

If you don’t want to enable cascade, you have **three clean options**.

---

### ✅ Option 1: Manually delete child rows first

This is the **most common and safest** approach.

```ts
await postRepository.delete({ user: { id: 1 } });
await userRepository.delete(1);
```

Or if your relation column is explicit:

```ts
await postRepository.delete({ userId: 1 });
await userRepository.delete(1);
```

💡 Always delete the **child rows first**, then the parent.

---

### ✅ Option 2: Use `onDelete: 'SET NULL'` in relation

If you don’t want to delete the posts but just “detach” them from the user:

```ts
@ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.posts, {
  onDelete: 'SET NULL',
})
user: User;
```

Now, when you delete a user:

* The user row is removed.
* All posts that referenced it will have `userId = NULL`.

No constraint error, and no data loss.

---

### ✅ Option 3: Use `onDelete: 'CASCADE'`

If you want the database to automatically delete child rows:

```ts
@ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.posts, {
  onDelete: 'CASCADE',
})
user: User;
```

Then, when you delete a user, the database itself automatically deletes all posts referencing it — even without `cascade: true` in TypeORM.

✔ Works at **DB level**
✔ Doesn’t require you to delete manually
✔ Works even if you delete via raw SQL

---

### ⚠️ Option 4 (avoid): Disable FK constraints

You could (in theory) drop or disable foreign key constraints, but this is **never recommended**, because it can cause inconsistent data (orphaned records).

Example (not recommended):

```sql
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;
DELETE FROM user WHERE id = 1;
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1;
```

This is only for debugging or temporary data cleanup.

| Delete parent safely without cascade         | Delete child rows first    | `await postRepo.delete({ userId: 1 }); await userRepo.delete(1);` |
| Keep child rows but detach                   | Use `onDelete: 'SET NULL'` | `{ onDelete: 'SET NULL' }`                                        |
| Delete parent and all children automatically | Use `onDelete: 'CASCADE'`  | `{ onDelete: 'CASCADE' }`                                         |
| Debugging only (unsafe)                      | Disable FK temporarily     | `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;`                                       |

## 🧾 4️⃣ Example Demo

### Entities

```ts
@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  name: string;

  @OneToMany(() => Post, (post) => post.user)
  posts: Post[];
}
```

```ts
@Entity()
export class Post {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  title: string;

  @ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.posts, { onDelete: 'CASCADE' })
  user: User;
}
```

### Delete Example

```ts
await userRepository.delete(1);
```

✅ Automatically deletes related posts (no error).

Without `onDelete: 'CASCADE'`, you’d need:

```ts
await postRepository.delete({ userId: 1 });
await userRepository.delete(1);
```

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

> ❓**“How can I delete without cascade?”**

✅ Delete child rows manually first
✅ or use `onDelete: 'SET NULL'`
✅ or use `onDelete: 'CASCADE'` for auto-delete
